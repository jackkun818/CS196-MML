        "Story": "In the suburbs of the city, there is a lively agricultural produce market, known for its fresh produce. This Friday, the market reopened after a period of rest and recuperation, attracting many citizens to come and buy. In the market, vendors enthusiastically sell home-grown agricultural products, including fresh tomatoes, crispy cucumbers, golden corn and juicy oranges. Citizens shuttled between various stalls, selecting their favorite ingredients, and their faces were filled with the pursuit of a healthy life. In the market, there are not only fresh agricultural products, but also jams and honey made on-site, as well as various handicrafts. Under the guidance of parents, the children were curiously observing various agricultural products and learning their growth process. The opening of the market every Friday not only provides citizens with a good place to buy fresh ingredients, but also provides local farmers with a platform to display and sell their own agricultural products.",
