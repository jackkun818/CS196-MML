Difficulty 5
Dongpo pork is also known as boiling pork and braised pork. Dongpo stewed meat comes from the great poet Su Shi. In the fourth year of Yuanyou of Emperor Zhezong of Song Dynasty, Su Shi served as the governor of Hangzhou. When Taihu Lake was flooded and large areas of crops were flooded, Su Shi made a quick decision and organized migrant workers to dredge the West Lake, build dikes and bridges, helping the people in western Zhejiang to survive the most difficult times. The people of Hangzhou thanked Su Shi for his kindness. During the Chinese New Year, they carried pigs and wine to greet him. Su Shi refused to accept gifts from the people, so he instructed his family to cut the pork into cubes, cooked it red and crispy, and distributed it to the migrant workers who participated in the dredging of the West Lake. After eating, everyone was surprised and respected Su Dongpo's moral integrity and integrity, and loved the people as much as his son. He affectionately called the meat he sent.“Dongpo meat”, and has been passed down to this day.
